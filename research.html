 RESEARCH: <br>
 <br><br><br><br>
 SoundCloud has much less ad revenue than Spotify. SoundCloudâ€™s producers, the users uploading content, are there to build a following and are the reason why soundcloud is as big as it is today.
 The agreement with Universal simply wards off any potential lawsuits over copyright infringement. <br>
 In contrast, Spotify pays out 80 percent of its revenue to content license holders. <br>
 Many of the artist that we know now have come from soundcloud and have made a following and gained a big fanbase to go off of. <br>
 When you think of underground music the first thing you think about soundcloud and how big it has made people in the music industry. <br>
